/**
 * @brief Downsampler to manage rate of packets sent to client
 *
 * PipeBroadcaster and WireBroadcaster by default sends packets to all clients when
 * a pipe packet is sent or the wire value is changed. The updates typically happen
 * within a sensor or control loop, with the rate set by the specific device producing
 * the updates. Some clients may require less frequent data, and may run in to bandwidth
 * or processing issues if the data is sent at the full update rate. The BroadcastDownsampler
 * is used to implement broadcaster predicates that will drop packets.
 * Clients specify how many packets they want dropped between each packet sent. For instance,
 * a downsample of 0 means that no packets are dropped. A downsample of 1 will drop every other
 * packet. A downsample of two will drop 2 packets between sending 1 packet, etc. The
 * downsample level for each client is set using SetClientDownsample(). This should be
 * made available to the client using a property member.
 *
 * PipeBroadcaster and WireBroadcaster must be added to the downsampler
 * using AddPipeBroadcaster() and AddWireBroadcaster(), respectively.
 * It is recommended that these functions be called within
 * an IRRServiceObject::RRServiceObjectInit() override.
 *
 * BeginStep() and EndStep() must be called for each iteration of the
 * broadcasting loop. Use BroadcastDownsamplerStep for automatic
 * management in the loop.
 *
 * See com.robotraconteur.isoch.IsochDevice for the standard use
 * of downsampling.
