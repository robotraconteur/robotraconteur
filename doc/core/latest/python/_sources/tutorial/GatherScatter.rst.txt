Gather/Scatter operations
=========================

In many situations it is necessary to query data from dozens or hundreds of sensors. Thanks to the asynchronous
functionality discussed in Section `[asyncprog] <#asyncprog>`__ this is possible and is limited only by memory and
network bandwidth. An example of a practical application of gather/scatter operations is that of an advanced lighting
system that needs to rapidly query large numbers of sensors, make control decisions, and then distribute updated
commands to a large number of lighting fixtures. Consider a list of connections that have already been connected and are
stored in a variable ``c_list``. Each connection is to a service that has the function ``ReadSensor()`` that returns
some important data. Example `[gatherscatter] <#gatherscatter>`__ will query each sensor concurrently and call the
handler when all the sensors have been queried.
