# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Wason Technology, LLC is dedicated to software security. Please notify us immediately if you discover a security
vulnerability in one of your projects.

Please submit vulnerability reports by emailing softwaresecurity@wasontech.com, preferably in English. The more information provided about the bug, the easier it will be to fix. If you already have a fix, please include it with your report. We may ask to exchange PGP keys to discuss sensitive details about the vulnerability which may include proof-of-concept code, an impact assessment, recommended remediation steps or other information that will help us find and fix the problem.

Include any plans you may have to disclose details about the vulnerability. In order to protect our users, unless otherwise agreed by both parties, we ask that you not publicly discuss the vulnerability until a fix is published or at least 90 days have passed since the initial report submission. The group handling the report will also follow this timeline. If you do not wish to be acknowledged in the release communications please indicate so when you submit the vulnerability.

Vulnerabilities will be recorded in the next release after the vulnerability has been repaired. Special releases
may be issued to fix specific vulnerabilities outside of normal release schedules.
